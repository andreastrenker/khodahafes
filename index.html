      The photo exhibition <em>khoda hafes</em> (Persian:
      Goodbye) by designer and documentary
      photographer Andreas Trenker portrays his
      journey through the Islamic Republic of Iran.
      Thereby he explores the country and critically
      examines his eurocentric perspective on a
      culture foreign to him. Which images were
      created beforehand in his mind? Which are
      constructed or a result of Western
      expectations towards a Muslim country?
      Which, on the other hand, are spontaneous
      and challenge clicheÃÅs and prejudices? The
      answers to these questions also lie in the
      viewer's perspective. That is why the
      photographer decided to highlight the local
      narrative by having Iranians comment on his
      photo series. Their oral footnotes to the
      individual images and the bias of the
      Western view of their country can be found
      as a critical audio guide in the exhibition. In
      this way, Trenker opens up his role as a
      photographer for discussion and focuses on
      the dialogue between representation and subject.
